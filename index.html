                "A picture says a thousand words. Photography keeps memories alive and prosperous because it freezes a scene that lasts forever. Many people have cameras just for that reason. When you take a photo, you capture not only the scene, you capture the feeling and emotion. Some people like photography as a hobby because it is very relaxing and euphoric. Photographs are used to convey messages without having to say a single word. That is how strong a single photograph can be. Photography is a beautiful skill that can document events, natural scenery, and can be used for artistic projects.
                Every day in normal circumstances people take thousands of pictures of the Grand Canyon. It takes very little thought to realize that few if any of these pictures will be in any way noteworthy above pictures already taken. But that said, they are OUR pictures, our personal affirmation of the wonderful scene stretched out below us, and that gives them a special validity for us."
